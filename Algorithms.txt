Algorithm :: it is a step by step process for solving the problems.
----------
1) write a Algorithm to accept 2 values from user & provide addition of  2 numbers ?

step1 : accept 1st value
step2 : accept 2nd value
step3 : addition of value1,value2
step4 : display addition value

2) substraction, multiplication,division for 2 values

step1 : accept 1st value
step2 : accept 2nd value
step3 : substraction of value1,value2
step4 : display substraction value
----------------------------------
step1 : accept 1st value
step2 : accept 2nd value
step3 : multiplication of value1,value2
step4 : display multiplication value
--------------------------------------
step1 : accept 1st value
step2 : accept 2nd value
step3 : division of value1,value2
step4 : display division value

3) write a Algorithm to accept employee salary & 3 Shopping bills & find
  1) Total Shopping amount
  2) how much % of amount employee is spending on shopping on his/her salary

Steps
-----

step1 : accept employee salary
step2 : accept shopping bill1
step3 : accept shopping bill2
step4 : accept shopping bill3
step5 : Add total shopping amount (100+200+300)
step6 : % of amount employee is spending on shopping on his/her salary(100+200+300)*100/1000
step7 : display total shopping amount
step8 : display % spending on shopping amount
